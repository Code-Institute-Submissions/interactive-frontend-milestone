            <p>
                Even if you’ve never been to Dubai before, you’ve probably heard something about it. It’s a city that breaks records all the time. It’s home to everything from the world’s tallest building to the world’s largest sweet shop. If you’re planning on visiting Dubai, though, you might want to know about the best places to go. And if that’s the case, then you’re in luck. This website has all the information you need to know about Dubai’s top ten tourist attractions, from the Burj Khalifa to IMG Worlds of Adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of people visiting Dubai increases every year, making the emirate one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. From January to June of 2019, for example, more than 8 million tourists holidayed in Dubai. The number’s only going to increase in 2020, with the launch of Expo 2020 – there are estimated to be around 20 million visitors to Dubai this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many people visit Dubai, not a lot of people know their way round. People know about landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa or the Burj Al Arab, but it’s difficult to get a sense of how the city is laid out, particularly because the heat means you can’t walk around outside. Instead, people make use of the city’s taxis, buses, or the Dubai Metro. This website aims to show visitors how Dubai is laid out, and where exactly the city’s top landmarks are. Read on to find out more.
