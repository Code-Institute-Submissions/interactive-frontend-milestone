# Dominic Beesley’s 2nd Milestone Project

The aim of this project is to build an interactive front-end site, which should respond to users’ actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, and alter the way the site displays this information in order to achieve their preferred goals, using all the technologies that I've learned about so far, for Code Institute. 

To do this, I’ve created a website that’s a guide to Dubai, a city in the UAE. I used my knowledge of the city to do this, as I lived there for several years, and felt like I know more than the average tourist would.

## UX

## Features

### Existing Features

* Arrow icon – When the user clicks on the down arrow in the site’s header, the page will scroll down to show more of the content. The code for this can be found at assets/js/accordion.js.

* Map of Dubai – made with a Google Maps API. The code for the map can be found at assets/js/map.js.

* Accordion panel – this gives more information on the top 10 landmarks. When the name is clicked, the panel of information will appear, and disappear when clicked again. The code for this can be found at assets/js/accordion.js.

## Technologies Used


## Testing
I tested the website on multiple browsers and screen sizes, to ensure that it worked and displayed all the content correctly for the user, and that the contents were responsive on different screen sizes. I also got several friends and members of my family to test the website and ensure that everything worked for them, and that they didn’t have any questions to be addressed.


## Deployment
The website is deployed using GitHub pages. 

On the page for the GitHub repository for this project, I went to Settings.

I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. 

I chose Master Branch as the source, and this gave me the link to where the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. It’s deployed from the master branch, and will update automatically.
